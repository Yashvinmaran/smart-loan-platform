# Admin Frontend Responsiveness Fixes

## Current Issues:
- Admin sidebar completely hides on mobile using transform: translateX(-100%)
- Dashboard and sidebar overlap on smaller screens
- Summary cards don't stack properly on mobile

11. [x] Improve AdminSidebar.jsx component
12. [x] Improve AdminDashboard.jsx layout
13. [x] Update button.jsx with smooth transitions
